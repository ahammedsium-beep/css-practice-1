        <h3>
            How the president of Venezuela was arrested?
        </h3>
        <p>
            In a surprise military operation early January, U.S. forces struck Caracas and captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, during a coordinated raid, <span class = "highlight">transporting them to the United States to face criminal charges including narco-terrorism and drug trafficking</span>. The operation, ordered by U.S. leadership, followed months of rising tensions and accusations that Maduro's government engaged in large-scale drug smuggling. Explosions were reported in Caracas as the raid unfolded, prompting international outcry over sovereignty and legality. Venezuela's leadership condemned the move, while some opposition figures welcomed Maduro's removal, sparking deep controversy worldwide.
